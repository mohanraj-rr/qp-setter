            <h2>About the Department of Mathematics</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The Department of Mathematics is one of the largest units of Anna University with faculty strength of 70 to cater the needs of the Under-Graduate and Post-Graduate programmes in Science, Engineering and Technology. The Department has been started in the year 1975 with M.Sc. programme in Mathematics. In 1979, research programmes were started which are leading to M.Phil, and Ph.D. in Mathematics. Subsequently in the year 1993, it has started M.Sc. Mathematics with Diversification in Computer Science, which was renamed as M.Sc. (Computer Science) in 1997. From the academic year 2001, Five-year Integrated M.Sc Programmes in Computer Science and Information Technology are being offered. These two programmes are successfully offering by the Department of Mathematics and most of the students are placed in IT companies across the world.
               <br> <br> The Department of Mathematics is recognized as DST - FIST sponsored Department in Anna University. The Department of Mathematics has been sanctioned Rs.52 Lakhs for five years by the Department Science and Technology from 21.05.2014</p>
